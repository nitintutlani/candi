Candi
-----
Dependency injection library written in typescript for node.js

Why this name?
--------------
it CAN do Dependency Injection
I am working on a set of libraries to participate in a future project. This is first installment. More CAN do libraries to come.

Disclaimer
----------
PS: This has no dependencies. It should work on browser too. ECMAScript5 support is required. >=IE9 and all other modern browsers have it.
PS: I have ran my tests on node v0.10.22 only, but I am confident it will work on 0.8 or earlier also. Please run tests using `npm test` before using.

Thanks
------
Creators of Pimple, Rewire and AngularJS have done tremendous job implementing Dependency Injection techniques.
I am thankful to their respective authors for sharing knowledge and work with the community.

TODO
----
All usable features I could think of are done. I will add more in readme, generate api, wiki tutorials later if requested.
Injections for value, constant, provider, factory and service - all are here.

Usage
-----
Review code and tests files for usage they have almost everything needed to get going.

Last words
----------
This DI works for me!

Whats next?
-----------
I will continually bug fix this library (although I have tested this top to bottom). Hey! any request and support from you is welcome.
